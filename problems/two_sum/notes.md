This code defines a class named "Solution" that contains a method named "twoSum", which takes two parameters: an array of integers named "nums" and an integer named "target". The purpose of this method is to find two numbers in the "nums" array that add up to the "target" value and return the indices of those numbers in the array.

The first line of the method creates a HashMap called "map" that will be used to store the complement of each number in the "nums" array and its corresponding index in the array.

The following line is a for loop that iterates through all the elements in the "nums" array.

Inside the for loop, we first create a variable named "complementIdx" which is the target minus the current element(nums[i]) in the for loop, this will give us the number we should look in the array to add up to target.

Then, the code checks if the current element (nums[i]) is present in the "map", if it is, this means we have found two numbers that add up to the target value, and we can return the indices of these numbers. The indices are stored in the map as values. So, the first value returned would be the map.get(nums[i]) which is the complement index and the next value returned would be the current index i.

If the current element is not present in the map, we add it to the map with the complementIdx as the key, and the current index i as the value.

Finally, after the for loop, the code throws an "IllegalArgumentException" with a message "No two sum found" if the loop completes and no pair of numbers that add up to the target value is found.

This method takes advantage of the O(1) look up time of the hashmap, so it runs in O(n) time complexity.
